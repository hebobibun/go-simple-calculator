# Golang Simple Calculator App

Hi! I built a simple calculator app with Go Language for my learning journey where you can do some operations :

1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Division (รท)
4. Multiplication (x)

You can also see the history of your previous calculations.

cd go-simple-calculator
```

- Open the project on your code editor
- Open the terminal and run the program with command

```
go run .
